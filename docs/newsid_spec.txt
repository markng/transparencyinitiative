 NewsCredit specification
======================

(Note: NewsCredit is provisional name - if we think of anything better
I'll be doing a search&replace - BenC ;-)

NewsCredit is a set of conventions for adding semantic information to
news articles on web pages, for any pretty fuzzy and wide definition
of "news articles" you want to use.

It is built on top of the hAtom microformat (see
http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom). While hAtom is primarily intended for
adding syndication features to standard HTML pages, it also provides
useful conventions for most of the data NewsCredit intends to provide.

So NewsCredit extends hAtom by adding extra fields.  hAtom and NewsCredit should be valid examples of each other.

This document will try to avoid repeating the hAtom specification as much
as possible.

Some basic familiarity with the concepts behind microformats is assumed.


Integrated NewsCredit versus Embedded blocks
----------------------------------------

Ideally, news articles would use NewsCredit to provide semantic markup of the
whole article - headline, byline, content etc...

However, in many cases this may not be practical. Organisations may not
be willing to make such intrusive changes to their existing HTML, or legacy
CMS software might make it impractial.

In such cases, one option is to embed the NewsCredit data as a separate block
somewhere in the HTML. This would necessitate the replication of
information already on the page, but is an easy way to provide conformant
NewsCredit data with minimal impact upon existing systems and practices.


In General
----------

NewsCredit uses lower case class names. Hyphens are used to increase
readability.

By default, the human visible text contents of an element for a property
represents the value of that property.

If an <abbr> element is used for a property, then the 'title' attribute
of the <abbr> element is the value of the property, instead of the contents
of the element, which instead provide a human presentable version of the
value.


NewsCredit specific fields
----------------------

These fields are NewsCredit-specific additions to those already defined by
the hAtom microformat.

code-of-practice
  using rel-cop pattern - see that spec

history
  Optional. 
  An hcal list of changes to the document.  Example :
  <ol class="vcalendar history">
    <li class="vevent">
      <span class="summary">Removed spelling mistake</span> at <abbr class="dtstart" title="2008-03-12T08:30:00">8:30am on March 12th 2008</abbr> by <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="http://www.markng.co.uk/">Mark Ng</a> </span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
commissioned-by
  Optional
  The organisation which commissioned the piece, using hCard.

hAtom fields
------------

This is a quick list of the fields already specified by hAtom, with a few
notes on NewsCredit-specific details where appropriate.
See the full hAtom spec for more information.

bookmark
  (permalink) optional. Uses the rel-bookmark pattern.
  The URL of the article. If this is not present, the URL used to access
  the page should be assumed.

  Many sites allow a story to be accessed via multiple URLs. For example,
  the same story might appear in multiple sections of a newspaper. In these
  cases a single, canonical URL *must* be specified.

  The url serves two purposes:
  * it is a globally unique identifier, which databases may use to index
    and track the article.
  * it provides a path to get to the original article if you have its
    NewsCredit information.

entry-title
  required. Text.

entry-content
  optional (see hAtom spec for details)

entry-summary
  optional. Text.

updated
  required. Uses datetime-design-pattern.

published
  optional. Uses datetime-design-pattern.

author
  required. Uses hCard.
  Where applicable, the geo-tagging features of hCard should be used to
  provide location information about authors.
  Where there are multiple people involved in the production of an article, you should include others as extra editors.  The role attribute should be used to indicate what role each person played in the production of the article.
  *TODO: If we're looking to programatically parse this, I'm concerned about i18n here - however, we can't realistically ask specifically for a machine readable version and be very "microformatty" (Mark Ng)*
  For news articles, it's highly desirable that author hCards should
  include an email address, to provide a channel for readers to reply.
  *TODO: is that too preachy for a tech spec? Are papers likely to bristle
  at being told they should provide a right to reply? (BenC)*
  

tags
  optional
  keywords or phrases, using rel-tag.
  *TODO: not sure if this will cover what we need - it might not fit it
  with some newspapers existing tag system, but I'm not convinced that
  their tags are all that usful anyway.... (BenC)* 




Other issues regarding article URLs
-----------------------------------

There are a number of real-world cases where the URL of published articles
are not consistant. This is bad, because third party databases might have
indexed an article using one URL, and then see the same article published
under a new URL, thus creating duplicate entries.

* Some newspaper sites publish new revisions of articles by removing the
  old article and creating a whole new one, with a whole new url.

* If a news site moves to a new CMS, the URL scheme is likely to change.
  If they are wise they leave redirects in place to forward old-style
  requests on to the new article. But the new CMS will probably want to
  use the new URL in the NewsCredit block - ie the canonical URL has changed.

* News sites often run multiple CMSs in parallel, each with their own URL
  format. For example, they might have one CMS for the main newspaper,
  and another for journalist blogs. Normally this is not an issue, but
  sometimes articles will be copied from one CMS to the other - a blog
  entry being used as an article in the printed edition of a newspaper,
  for example. In this case, the two versions of the article will have
  different URLs and so external databases will not easily be able to
  reconcile them.

* TODO: not sure there is any good solution to any of these... (BenC) *


Examples
--------

a fully marked up (but minimal!) article::

  <div class="hentry">
    <h2 class="entry-title">
      <a href="http://fredbloggs.com/big-blahs-on-horizon" rel="bookmark">
        Big Blahs On Horizon
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      By <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://fredbloggs.com">Fred Bloggs</a></span>
      on <abbr class="published" title="2008-09-03T12:52:22+0100">September 3, 2008 at 12:52 pm</abbr>
    </p>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</p>
      <p>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</p>
      <p>So there.</p>
    </div>
    <ol class="vcalendar history">
      <li class="vevent">
        <span class="summary">Initial publication</span> at <abbr class="dtstart" title="2008-03-12T08:30:00">8:30am on March 12th 2008</abbr> by <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn" href="http://fredbloggs.com/">Fred Bloggs</a> </span>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This article adheres to the <a rel="cop" href="http://fredbloggs.com/cop">The Fred Bloggs Seal of Utmost Integrity (tm)</a></p>
  </div>


a NewsCredit block for wedging into existing layouts with minimal impact:

  <div class="hentry">
    title: <span class="entry-title">Big Blahs On Horizon</span><br/>
    url: <a href="http://fredbloggs.com/big-blahs-on-horizon" rel="bookmark">Big Blahs On Horizon</a><br/>
    author: <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://fredbloggs.com">Fred Bloggs</a></span><br/>
    code of practice: <a class="code-of-practice" href="http://fredbloggs.com/cop">The Fred Bloggs Seal of Utmost Integrity (tm)</a><br/>
  </div>

*TODO: embedded block should probably be hidden, or replaced with a little
NewsCredit logo or soemthing like that. Maybe supply some example CSS too? *

*Embedded blocks being hidden isn't very microformat like - invisible metadata rots, we need to have a chat about this ?*
